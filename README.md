# Usage

The present web interface is used in the XLE+Glue web application. This app has two instantiations: one for working with the Xerox Linguistics environment and one one for working with Universal Dependencies as annotated by Stanza. 

The corresponding code can be found at:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Mmaz1988/xleplusglue/tree/2024_inference">XLE+Glue</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://github.com/Mmaz1988/xleplusglue/tree/2025_xleplusud">XLE+UD</a></li> 
</ul>

Due to the dual nature of the web interface, the master branch is deprecated and should not be used for development or testing of the app.
